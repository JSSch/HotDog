      <section id="main_content">
        <p>This is a silly name for a project, yes?  I guess it was my fault for saying hot dogs in class...</p>

<p>So this project mostly mirrored what we did for the MVC tutorial.  I started off with models that captured the attributes of the wireframe provided.  I knew that there were two components that could be updated for this profile, those being the edit button for the whole profile itself, and the list of recent hot dogs.  I decided I would make a view model for the list and use the edit method in the controller for the profile.  I would find that passing the list object through the edit method would be my first obstacle. I eventually found I needed to just create another view model.  That was tedious due to all the attributes and having two controllers.</p>

<p>I then got fed up looking at my date time showing the time, so I looked into changing the format using data annotations (again, like in the MVC tutorial we did).  That took a bit to figure out where to implement, but it went fine after that.</p>

<p>I guess I'm going to go eat some hot dogs when I get home tonight.  All beef kosher franks if I can help it.</p>
