{"name":"HotDogAssignment","tagline":"Assignment 9 for CIS 411","body":"This is a silly name for a project, yes?  I guess it was my fault for saying hot dogs in class...\r\n\r\nSo this project mostly mirrored what we did for the MVC tutorial.  I started off with models that captured the attributes of the wireframe provided.  I knew that there were two components that could be updated for this profile, those being the edit button for the whole profile itself, and the list of recent hot dogs.  I decided I would make a view model for the list and use the edit method in the controller for the profile.  I would find that passing the list object through the edit method would be my first obstacle. I eventually found I needed to just create another view model.  That was tedious due to all the attributes and having two controllers.\r\n\r\nI then got fed up looking at my date time showing the time, so I looked into changing the format using data annotations (again, like in the MVC tutorial we did).  That took a bit to figure out where to implement, but it went fine after that.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm going to go eat some hot dogs when I get home tonight.  All beef kosher franks if I can help it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
